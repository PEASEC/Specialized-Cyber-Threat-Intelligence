# Specialized-Cyber-Threat-Intelligence

This repository hosts the code to the model training technique including a novel pipeline combining transfer learning, data augmentation, and few-shot learning for developing an effective specialized cyber threat intelligence (CTI) classifier and Novel techniques of data augmentation and few-shot learning to deal with a small number of training instances.

Further explanitions contains the paper *Multi-Level Fine-Tuning, Data Augmentation, and Few-Shot Learning for Specialized Cyber Threat Intelligence* [1].
